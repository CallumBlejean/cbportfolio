            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Trippy</strong> is a travel planning application designed
              to simplify the complexities of organizing group trips. From
              collaborative itineraries to real-time communication, Trippy helps
              travelers focus on enjoying their experiences rather than managing
              logistics. Whether planning a family vacation, a getaway with
              friends, or a team outing, Trippy provides the tools needed to
              streamline group travel and ensure everyone is on the same page.
            </p>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose of Trippy is to minimize the stress of trip planning.
              Group trips often involve coordinating schedules, preferences, and
              communication, which can lead to miscommunication and chaos.
              Trippy was built to centralize the process, saving users time and
              effort while reducing the likelihood of errors or
              misunderstandings.
